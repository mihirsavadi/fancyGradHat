- routing is 2 layer and without consideration of EMI -- signal integrity throughout the board wont be guaranteed, and
likely to be extremely unreliable, causing complete failure of the board. This is especially likely because of the
numerous high(ish) speed parallel lines between the FPGA PCI connector, LED matrix Driver IC's, and the LED matrix.
Revision 2 should employ a 4 layer PCB instead with proper grounding.
